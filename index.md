The Pash-Project is an Open Source reimplementation of [Windows PowerShell](http://microsoft.com/powershell) on Mono.

Due to the size/scope of PowerShell itself, Pash has a long ways to go. However you may be surprised at how active some contributors to the project are and how useful the project can actually be in certain contexts.
